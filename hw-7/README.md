# Report your process
* I honestly found this assignment pretty challenging as I had missed the makefile lectures. Nonetheless, I found that [Jenny's tutorial](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io/tree/master/automation10_holding-area/01_automation-example_just-r) was super helpful.
* I had some trouble creating the lm() function to run a regression on all countries and then output the summary statistics
* I also had trouble originally getting the data to download
* Overall this was a challenging but useful assignment in hindsight. I definitely would like to review this material in more depth to get a proper grasp on it!
