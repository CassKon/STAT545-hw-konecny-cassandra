Homework 01: Edit README.md and Use R Markdown
Welcome to the repository of Cassandra Konecny.I am a first year MSc student in the department of zoology working with Dr. Christopher Harley. I am interested in how climate change (i.e. how changes in salinity, temperate, pH) influence species interactions and community composition. I am also an avid SCUBA diver and enjoy spending time in the ocean!
