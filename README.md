Welcome to the repository of **Cassandra Konecny**. I am a first year MSc student in the department of zoology working with Dr. Christopher Harley. I am interested in how climate change (i.e. how changes in salinity, temperate, pH) influence species interactions and community composition. I am also an avid SCUBA diver and enjoy spending time in the ocean!

Plese find my Gapminder Exploration work [**here**](https://github.com/CassKon/STAT545-hw01-konecny-cassandra/blob/1319253c3a6d9a90b4997fda470c72ea66907c3c/hw01_gapminder.md).
