The homework assignment can be found here:\n\n[**Homework 01: Edit README.md and Use R Markdown**](http://stat545.com/hw01_edit-README.html)\n\nMy compleed assignment can be found here: \n\n[**Cassandr Konecny hw01**](https://github.com/CassKon/STAT545-hw-konecny-cassandra/tree/abe9b9e09d1049258ed481a859144ea36eded3ec/hw-1)\n\n## Process and Documentation\n\n* I created a public repository on GitHub and initiated the readme file \n* I originally edited the read me file on GitHub and added in my introduction text.\n* I then used R studio to create a new project and make a copy of the repo on my local machine.\n* I then made a series of modifications (added links, bold text, a quote and an image) by opening the readme .md file in RStudio. I used * the suggested workflow of pulling from GitHub, making changes, saving the changes, Committing the changes and then pushing them each time.\n* I originally also added the homework link but then deleted it on GitHub as I decided to include it in the issue instead.\n\nOverall, I feel like I now have a better understanding of the workflow outlined and how each step contributes to a better experience! It was a useful exercise to review working both on GitHub and locally.\n\n",
