The homework assignment can be found here:\n\n[**Homework 05: Factor and figure management; Repo hygiene**](http://stat545.com/hw05_factor-figure-boss-repo-hygiene.html)\n\nMy completed assignment can be found here: \n\n[**Cassandr Konecny hw05**](https://github.com/CassKon/STAT545-hw-konecny-cassandra/blob/8096e82ebe24fa0768004ab5d82c8c4e6f042a05/hw-5/HW-05.md)\n\n\n# Report your process\n\n* Overall this assignment was pretty staight forward but I definitely learned some useful things as to what certain functions accomplish vs don't accomplish. For example the difference in changing factor levels vs arranging data or the differece in saving as a csv vs. a rds file.\n\n* It took be a few tries to apply the RColorBrewer and viridis color schemes to my plots. I think this was mostly to do with a mistmatch between the function that I was using and the data type. \n\n* I  used the class notes to complete this assignment along with these documents:\n[Package ‘viridis’, ](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/viridis.pdf)\n[readRDS, ](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.4.1/topics/readRDS)\n[Write CSV in R](http://rprogramming.net/write-csv-in-r/)",
