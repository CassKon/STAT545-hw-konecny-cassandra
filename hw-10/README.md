# Reporting

**Report your process**

* Overall I found this assignment okay ...
* I had trouble coming up with something interesting to do and so I wouldn't exactly label my assignment as interesting!
* The most difficult part for me was understanding has toa access the elements returned by the query
* There are at least a few problems that I am aware of that I didn't try to solve:
    * You don't get directions to you final destination
    * If you enter two locations you do however as your second location entered is also your destination!
    * I could definitely fix this with some error handling ans if statements
  There is no way to check whether it is actually sending you to the right location - Hopefully google knows everything?
* I could see this being useful in the future to access datasets from the web and bring them into r for analysis.
