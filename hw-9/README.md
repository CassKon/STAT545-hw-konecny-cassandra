# Reflections on assignment
* Overall I found this assignment pretty straight forward
* I found that there were a lot of different components to keep track of and manage as I made changes to the package
* I also spent a fair bit of time figuring out how the test that files worked and how to add basic error handling to the functions
* This was definitely a useful assignment and overview of developing R packages but I can't say that I am looking forward to building may of them in the future!

Enjoy!
