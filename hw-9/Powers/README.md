Powers
======

The goal of Powers is to perform simple power computations. A recent addition to the package however is the option to also calculate the differece between two numbers and the ability to perform and plot simple linear regressions using the diff and regress functions.

Functions available
-------------------

-   square
-   cube
-   tenvec
-   diff
-   regress

Example
-------

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem using the square () function:

``` r
# Load package
library(Powers)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'Powers'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     diff
# square number
square(5)
#> [1] 25
```
